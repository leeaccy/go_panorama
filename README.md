# Go Panorama
This is the official code for the project "Go Panorama" of EECS 504 Foundations of Computer Vision in Fall 2023 at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

## Preparation
Install the required dependency.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running
You can run our code using the following script.

`python3 pana.py`

More image data is available in the `./Dataset` directory, and if you wish to use a different dataset, you may do so by modifying line 45 of the `pana.py` file. If you choose to use your own captured images, please name the files in the order they were taken, starting from `0.jpg` on the right and proceeding leftward.
